1. Introduction

1.1 Background

The Fourier Transform is an integral transform used in various fields of enginecring and
science. The process transforms a function of time-domain f(¢) to a function of frequency-
domain f(w), and its applications range from analyzing complex waveforms for signal
processing to efficiently solving partial differential equations. The Fourier Transform is
mathematically denoted

[ ” p(tje*tat (1.1)

 

The inverse Fourier transform, as the name suggests, serves as an inverse process to the
Fourier transform described by Equation (1.1). The process changes a frequency-domain
function f (w) back into a function of time-domain f(t), which is useful for extrapolating the
original waveform given a frequency distribution function. The inverse Fourier Transform
is defined as

Ff) = 40) =f flweaw (12)

The Fourier transform can only be applied to functions that are defined on continuous
time signals. For most real-world applications, this condition is satisfied as signals are
processed over a given period of time. However, in order to mathematically apply the
Fourier transform, the time signal must be observed infinitely precisely. This poses a
fundamental problem for applying the mathematical notations expressed by Equations
(1.1) and (1.2). In real-world scenarios, a function f(t) can only be sampled at points
between finitely spaced intervals. In such cases, we apply numerical methods such as
discrete Fourier transform and fast Fourier transform, which we explore in detail in this
report.

1.2 Derivation of the Fourier Transform

The concept of Fourier transform is motivated by the study of the Fourier series, where a
complex wave function is broken down to a sum of simpler sine and cosine functions. The
complex Fourier series synthesis equation is denoted as
