Scientific Document Parser
==========================

"The Vision"
    - A free-to-use web application for viewing scientific documents.
    - Before loading the document, parser goes through each line and recognizes
      lines such as "...where N denotes number of calls..." and remembers it.
    - Whenever the user clicks/hovers over relevant instances of remembered
      variables (particularly in an equation), a pop-up appears nearby that
      reminds the user what the variables denotes.
    - Syntax-highlighting for stored variables, pop-up animations, etc.


Execution
    Final product requires (at least) the following components:
    - the Parser
        -- mainly natural language processing
        -- recognizing when a variable should be initialized
         * keywords such as "denotes, means, is"
        -- recognizing when a variable should be recalled
         * ex. if "a" is stored as a variable, how to distinguish it as a
           variable vs. a regular word?

    - web deployment
        -- front end
         * make it not ugly
        -- back end:
         * handling server client interactions
         * security (maybe not a big deal since no sensitive info should be
           stored on server or deployed from server)
